1.
Statically Type Language-language check the type during compile time.
Dynamically Type Language-language check the type during run time.
Stronly Type Language-language that strongly consider the data type.
Loosely Type Language-language that doesn't care much about the data type.

So Java is Strongly typed and Statically typed language.

2.
Case Sensitive->Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase characters in string comparisons.
example: "IJSE" and "ijse" are considered different.

Case Insensitive->Ignores the difference between uppercase and lowercase characters in comparisons.
example:"IJSE" and "ijse" are considered as same.

Case Sensitive-Insensitive->Provides an option to choose 
example: "IJSE" and "ijse" can be considered same or different.

In java ,the defualt behavior for String compertion is case sensitive.
